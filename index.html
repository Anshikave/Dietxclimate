<h1 style="font-family:Matura MT Script Capitals; color:#336699; font-size:60px;">What is a plant based diet?</div><h1>
<div style="color:6093C6; font-family:Segoe Script;">A plant-based diet is exactly what it sounds like. The diet consists primarily of food made of plants: fruits and vegetables in addition to nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes. <br>
A plant-based diet is not a vegetarian or vegan diet; you can eat poultry, beef, eggs, fish, and dairy products, however most of your nutrient intake is coming from plant-based food sources. There is no set ratio of plant to animal foods on a plant-based diet, but at least 2/3 of each plate of food (or meal) you eat is a good way to start. The emphasis should be on plants.</div>

<h1 style="font-family:Matura MT Script Capitals; color:#336699; font-size:60px;">Why plant based diet?</div><h1><ul style="font-family:MV Boli"><li>Transitioning to plant-based diets (PBDs) has the potential to reduce diet-related land use by 76%, diet-related greenhouse gas emissions by 49%, eutrophication by 49%, and green and blue water use by 21% and 14%, respectively.<br>

<li>Plant based food such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and lentils â€“ generally use less energy, land, and water, and have lower greenhouse gas intensities than animal-based foods.<br>

</li><li>As you see, in a food chain, nutrients decrease by 10% each time. Thus, being close to the producer will help us gain more nutrients.</li>
